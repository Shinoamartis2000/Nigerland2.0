The trajectory documents a complex, multi-stage development and debugging process for the Nigerland Consult Limited website. The initial AI engineer successfully built a full-stack application (React/FastAPI) with basic features. The work transitioned to implementing significant enhancements requested by the user, primarily a sophisticated admin panel and robust payment systems.

The development was marked by iterative debugging cycles. Key challenges included:
1.  **Frontend Build Errors**: An initial advanced admin component () had malformed JSX, which was fixed.
2.  **Backend Routing Catastrophe**: A major issue arose where all admin-related API endpoints returned 404 errors. This was traced to how FastAPI routers were nested. The solution involved changing  to  in  for all modular routers, a critical architectural change.
3.  **Data Validation**: Numerous Pydantic model validation errors occurred after fixing the routing. This required creating and repeatedly modifying a database seeding script () to align mock data with backend models.
4.  **Paystack Authentication Failure**: A persistent 401 Unauthorized error from Paystack, even with a new API key, was a major blocker. The root cause was discovered to be Python's module caching. The  was instantiated at module import time, caching the old key. The fix was adding  to  to ensure the environment is loaded before the client is created.

The AI engineer refactored the entire conference payment flow to mirror the working book purchase system after repeated failures. The process demonstrates a transition from feature creation to deep, systematic debugging of architectural and environment-related issues. The user's primary language is English. Future responses should be in English.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build and enhance a comprehensive website for Nigerland Consult Limited.

**Phase 1 (Completed):**
A full-stack application was created using React and FastAPI, featuring a public-facing website with pages for Home, About, Conference, Books, and Contact. Core functionalities included conference registration and e-book purchasing, both integrated with Paystack for payments and SendGrid for email notifications. A basic admin login was also implemented.

**Phase 2 (In Progress):**
The user requested a major expansion, focusing on administrative capabilities and content diversification.
1.  **Advanced Admin Panel:** A feature-rich dashboard for comprehensive site management, including analytics, financial tracking (revenue, payments), and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all content types: Conferences, E-books, Training Programs, MoreLife Sessions, Team Members, Projects, and Announcements.
2.  **New Content & Payment Flows:** Implementation of MoreLife Sessions and Training Programmes sections, and a robust, reliable payment system for all purchasable items (books, conference seats).
3.  **UI/UX and Content Updates:** Add all provided e-books (including those to be delivered by email), update pricing, and fix all reported bugs, such as non-functional buttons and lack of user feedback on form submissions (now fixed with toasts).
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Architecture**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.
- **API Integrations**:
    - **Paystack**: Processing payments for e-books and conference registrations.
    - **SendGrid**: Transactional email notifications (pending domain verification).
    - **Tawk.to**: Live chat widget.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for the admin panel.
- **Backend**: Modular routing in FastAPI, Pydantic for data validation, and  for environment variable management. A critical fix involved understanding Python's module caching behavior.
- **Frontend**: Component-based architecture with Shadcn UI, , and  for API communication.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo structure with separate  and  directories.



- ****: The main FastAPI entry point. It was significantly refactored to resolve a critical routing issue. Instead of nesting routers, modular routers (, , etc.) are now included directly on the main  object with a prefix (e.g., ). This ensures routes are resolved correctly.

- ****: Contains the . A critical bug was fixed by adding  and calling  at the top of the file. This solved a persistent 401 Unauthorized error caused by Python's module caching mechanism using an old API key.

- ****: A new script created to populate the MongoDB database with initial data. It was edited multiple times to fix Pydantic validation errors by ensuring the seed data structure matched the  definitions. A newer script, , was created to handle book updates specifically.

- ****: A new, completely rebuilt admin dashboard created to replace a buggy predecessor. It features a tabbed interface for managing all content types. It has been extensively modified to add data fetching, state management for CRUD dialogs, and financial overview components.

- ****: A new backend file created to implement a simplified, more reliable conference payment flow. This was a strategic decision to abandon a complex, error-prone implementation and mirror the working book purchase logic.

- ** and **: These pages were completely refactored to use the new, simplified backend endpoint in . The goal was to eliminate persistent validation and payment errors.  currently has a bug due to a missing  import.

- ****: This file was edited to remove a Made with Emergent badge/script and to update the site's title and meta description. The user has also requested a favicon be added here.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the axios is not defined runtime error on the 2026 Conferences page.
- Add a favicon to the website.
- Ensure the financial figures on the admin Overview and Financials tabs correctly calculate and display total revenue from all completed book and conference payments.
- Fully implement the backend logic for the Add and Edit dialog forms in the admin panel.
- Confirm that SendGrid emails are functional after the user completes the domain verification outlined in .
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the process of fixing two user-reported issues.
1.  **2026 Conference Payment Error**: The user provided a screenshot showing a runtime error on the 2026 conference page when trying to make a payment. The previous engineer correctly identified the problem as a missing  import in  after rewriting the payment logic. The error message in the screenshot was .
2.  **Favicon Request**: The user asked to add a favicon to the website.

The trajectory ends immediately after the engineer states the plan to fix the  import and add the favicon, but before executing the fix. The immediate task was to edit  to add the required import statement.
